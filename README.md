    ##### Print a new number by adding one to each of its digit
    ---

    ###### Description 
    *A number is input in computer then a new no should get printed by adding one to each of its digit. If you encounter a 9, insert a 10 (don't carry over, just shift things around). For example, 998 becomes 10109.* 

    ###### Bonus 
    *Using recursion implement a function where the output described in the challenge above is used as an input in the same function (using recursion) for N times. For example, if N = 3 and input is 998 the output should be 10109, 212110, 323221, so the final output (returned value) should be 323221.*
